# E-commerce Application



## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the E-commerce Application, developed as a part of the Software Engineering course (CSE452) at the Faculty of Engineering, Computer Systems Engineering Department.
## Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

Develop and implement a user-friendly e-commerce application accessible via mobile application or any device with a web browser.

Enhance the efficiency of searching for specific products using various search and filtering methods.

Offer multiple payment methods and gateways to enhance the overall customer experience.

Ensure a robust and secure system that protects sensitive user data and information.
## Project Scope
The project includes the development of an e-commerce platform for buyers and sellers, along with a backend system for managing customer orders, seller inventory, delivery management, and payment management. The platform will operate in Egypt, specifically within large cities such as Cairo and Alexandria.
